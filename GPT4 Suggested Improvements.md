The user data assumes that the EC2 instance has internet access to install the necessary packages. If the instance is in a private subnet, additional steps may be needed to provide internet access.

Note: fair point, or you could build those packages into a custom AMI

The user data is quite long and complex. It might be better to move this into a separate script file and use the "file" function in Terraform to load it.

Note: again, fair point; but I kinda want to push this and come back later, still the best suggestion, and will add as an issue

The nginx configuration is hardcoded in the user data. It might be better to use a configuration management tool like Ansible or Chef to manage this configuration, especially if it's likely to change or if there are multiple servers to manage.

Note: kinda agree, but wanted to do provisioning instead of configuration management precisely because I hope this reverse proxy will become less and less useful as SDKs, platforms, tools, etc adopt open models

The Terraform code does not specify any tags for the EC2 instance other than "Name". Adding more tags could be useful for organization and cost tracking.

Note: yep, if you're reading this and plan to use this I guarantee your CI/CD pipeline folks are gonna want better tags; probably NetSec too.
